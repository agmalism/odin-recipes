        <h3><em>Authentic Indonesian Fried Rice</em></h3>
        <p>Nasi Goreng, in a nutshell, is Indonesian Fried Rice. It’s simple Indonesian cuisine, typically made with leftover rice, veggies, egg, and meat or shrimp, and it varies quite a bit depending on where you are in Indonesia. While 
            we were there, in the hot south, it was almost always served with something crunchy, cool, and fresh on the side.</p>
