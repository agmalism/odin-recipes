        <h3><em>Authentic Indonesian Fried Rice</em></h3>
        <p>Nasi Goreng, in a nutshell, is Indonesian Fried Rice. It’s simple Indonesian cuisine, typically made with leftover rice, veggies, egg, and meat or shrimp, and it varies quite a bit depending on where you are in Indonesia. While 
            we were there, in the hot south, it was almost always served with something crunchy, cool, and fresh on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 leek, chopped</li>
            <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>½ pound peeled and deveined shrimp</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>3 cups cold cooked white rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to Make</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>PHeat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. 
                Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30 seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin; mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice is heated 
                through and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
